and an admin panel to add classes. It uses the Django admin tools and user
authentication technology.

## Whats in the project

### Admin Panel Component

https://elearning-lab.org/admin/  
<website link>/admin => Developer admin panel (this came with Djano)

https://elearning-lab.org/admin_panel/  
<website link>/admin_panel => “user” admin panel (created)
There are two different admin panels, one is meant for a developer to look over and the other one is meant for the organization to use. I personally thought the admin panel for developers is confusing to the normal user so creating another admin panel for the Birdge2Africa organizations was needed. However, the user Admin panel still uses elements of the developer admin panel.

### Student Component

https://elearning-lab.org/student/welcome/28e4a600-54f3-476b-93d3-8c97d06f7283  
Holds the different course home, modules, connect, reading material, and assessments. Assessments uses google form for quizzes

### Home Component

https://elearning-lab.org/  
Holds the UI for the main page

### Courses Component

https://elearning-lab.org/courses  
Holds the UI for courses

### Discussion Board Component

https://github.com/E-Learning-Lab/E-Learning_Lab/tree/main/Components/discussion_board  
Contains the models, routes, views, and forms for the discussion board component. A course can contain many discussion boards associated with it. Upvotes/downvotes and profanity checker in place at this time.

### Virutallearninglab folder

https://github.com/E-Learning-Lab/E-Learning_Lab/tree/main/virtuallearninglab  
Main folder, it holds the UI for login and register, base templates for each page, routing, and settings of the project
